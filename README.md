```

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd finalProject
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Place your raw data files in the `data/raw` directory.
2. Use the `src/data_processing.py` script to clean and transform the data.
3. Train your models using the `src/model_training.py` script.
4. Evaluate the models with the `src/evaluation.py` script.
5. Explore the analysis and results in the `notebooks/finalProject.ipynb`.
